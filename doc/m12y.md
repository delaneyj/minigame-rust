yeah, i just build the .lib from SDL2's source
m12y
and i have lib/mac, lib/ios, lib/windows, etc folders in my project that each contain the appropriate .libs, and the i use a cargo build script to output "cargo:rustc-link-search=..." depending on which target i'm building for so cargo knows which lib folder to search

it's not super elegant, but it gets the job done

(and building SDL2 from source is not super fun)
